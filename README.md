![hard_solution](Images/rice-cookers-project1.jpg)

- - -
Demonstrate the correlation between urban construction and water retention during natural disasters. We utilized building permits to demonstrate city growth and FEMA / USGS data for flooding and subsidence. Plotting graphics, creating heatmaps to help visual the impact over the years.



## Project Development:

* Used Pandas to import, clean and format dataset(s).
* Created a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process and illustrating the final data analysis.
* Used Matplotlib to create a total of 8 visualizations of the data
* Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.

## Presentation Requirements:
You will also be responsible for preparing a formal, 10-minute presentation that covers:

* Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them
* Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
* The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
* The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
* Your conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary
* The implications of your findings: what do your findings mean?

## Suggested Data Sources:

Feel free to ask us (the instructional staff) for input, but our general advice is to
* stick to data sources that:
* Are sufficiently large.
* Have a consistent format.
* Ideally, contain more data than needed.
* Are well-documented.
