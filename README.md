# Project Requirements:
## Development Requirements:

* Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s).
* Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
* Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis.
* Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per ”question” you ask of your data).
* Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation.
* (Optional) Use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions.
* Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.

## Presentation Requirements:
You will also be responsible for preparing a formal, 10-minute presentation that covers:

* Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them
* Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
* The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
* The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
* Your conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary
* The implications of your findings: what do your findings mean?

## Suggested Data Sources:

Feel free to ask us (the instructional staff) for input, but our general advice is to
* stick to data sources that:
* Are sufficiently large.
* Have a consistent format.
* Ideally, contain more data than needed.
* Are well-documented.
